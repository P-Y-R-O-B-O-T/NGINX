# First, you will need to get server certificates
# and a private key and put them on the upstream
# server or on each server in the upstream group.
# A certificate can be obtained from a trusted
# certificate authority (CA) or generated using
# an SSL library such as OpenSSL.

# settig http server
http {
	# defining a upstream group
	upstream backend.example.com {
		# adding servers to upstream group
		server backend1.example.com:443;
		server backend2.example.com:443;
	}

	# a virtual server
	server {
		# listening on port 80
		listen      80;
		# defining server name
		server_name www.example.com;

		# routing requests
		location /upstream {
			# redirecting requests to upstream group
			proxy_pass                    https://backend.example.com;

			# Add the client certificate and the key that will
			# be used to authenticate NGINX on each upstream
			# server with proxy_ssl_certificate and
			# proxy_ssl_certificate_key directives:
			proxy_ssl_certificate         /etc/nginx/client.pem;
			proxy_ssl_certificate_key     /etc/nginx/client.key;

			# defining the ciphers that will be used
			proxy_ssl_protocols           TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
			proxy_ssl_ciphers             HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

			# If you use certificates issued by a CA, also include the
			# proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate directive to name the file
			# containing the trusted CA certificates used to verify the
			# upstreamâ€™s security certificates.
